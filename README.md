# My-Coding-Blog

This is a Jamstack App that uses two front ends and one backend to produce a blog. 

Technologies used in this project: React, CSS3, HTML5, Node.JS, Express

The first frontend is used to consume the apis that have been created in the backend (using node & express and hosted in railway). 

The second frontend is used as an admin portal for the blog. This means that full CRUD actions are assessable from this site.

Both frontends are hosted in github pages with the backend server being hosted in railway.
